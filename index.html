	<h1>Exploring Top Fifty Songs in 2019</h1>
	<h3>YuQi Huang</h3>
	<p>The dataset contains the most popular songs TOP 50 in 2019, which can be downloaded on the Kaggle website (https:https://www.kaggle.com/leonardopena/top50spotify2019). The objective of this project is to illustrate a story about the top songs in different categories. It aims to help users find their favorite music in 2019. </p>

	<h2>Alpha Release</h2>
	<h1>Overview and Features that have been completed</h1>
	<p>At this stage, I have predicted he popularity of a song by numerical features in the dataset. Inconclusion, the best predictors that used to predict popularity of a song in 2019 are Valence and Speechiness, in whichcoefficient of Valence is less than 0 and coefficient of Speechiness is larger than 0.</p>

	<h1>Upcoming immediate milestones</h1>
	<p>The upcoming work will be using D3 to display each visualization.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<h1>Roadblocks</h1>
	<p>For the energy, danceability, liveness, and valence of songs, my plan is to create histograms to show each individual. Since they are all digital information, I am still thinking what would be the best chart for this data.</p>
